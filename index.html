 <br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the Cherry&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <dl>
        <dd>The Black Republican cherry is a cultivar of cherry. While it is a hybrid, its parentage is not known; it is possibly a cross of the Napoleon and Black Tartarian cultivars, but has also been described as a seedling of the Eagle variety. One of the parents of the Bing cherry, the Black Republican was first grown in the U.S. state of Oregon about 1860 by the horticulturist Seth Lewelling, who gave it its name as a reflection of his Abolitionist beliefs.
The fruit of the Black Republican is small, firm, and deep purple in color, with an intense taste well-suited to preserving. It was a very important commercial cherry in the Pacific Northwest, but already by the early 20th century was being surpassed by the Bing cherry. Today it is a rare variety, with about 200 acres in production, and is listed as an endangered heritage food in the Ark of Taste.</dd><br>
        <dd>The Black Republican cherry tree is the parent of Bing cherry and a rare find at farmers markets. Black Republican cherry is revered for its exceedingly rich, sweet, intense black cherry flavor. Both the deep purple color and distinct flavor carry through in black cherry ice cream or yogurt. Some say the flavor is "earthy" with notes of rose, almond and/or herbs. The first Black Republican cherry tree was planted by Seth Lewelling, a nurseryman, Quaker and abolitionist who chose the name Black Republican in promotion of his abolitionist beliefs just after the Civil War. The Black republican cherries are medium-sized and of good quality; keeps and ships well. Pollinate with one of the following: Bing, Black Tartarian, Napoleon, Noir de Chavannes Cherry, Rainier, Lapins, Stella, and/or Van.
