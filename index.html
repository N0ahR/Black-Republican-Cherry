 <br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <dl>
        <dd>TThe Black Republican cherry is a cultivar of cherry. While it is a hybrid, its parentage is not known; although it is confirmed that this cherry is the parent of Bing cherry and a rare find at farmers markets, and it is possibly a cross of the Napoleon and Black Tartarian cultivars, but has also been described as a seedling of the Eagle variety. It was a very important commercial cherry in the Pacific Northwest, but already by the early 20th century was being surpassed by the Bing cherry. Today it is a rare variety, with about 200 acres in production, and is listed as an endangered heritage food in the Ark of Taste. The first Black Republican cherry tree was planted by Seth Lewelling, a nurseryman, Quaker and abolitionist who chose the name Black Republican in promotion of his abolitionist beliefs just after the Civil War.</dd><br>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit Characteristics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>Black Republican cherry is revered for its exceedingly rich, sweet, intense black cherry flavor. Both the deep purple color and distinct flavor carry through in black cherry ice cream or yogurt. Some say the flavor is "earthy" with notes of rose, almond and/or herbs.  The Black republican cherries are medium-sized and of good quality; keeps and ships well. </dd>
